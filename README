# Overview

This dataset was collected in 20233 and comprises electroencephalography, physiological and behavioural data acquired from 73 healthy individuals (ages: 21-45). The task was administered as part of a larger study.

# Task Description
## Fake Face (FF)
The objective of the study was to investigate if emotional arousal would affect people's perceived realness of others' faces, given ambiguous information. Before the task, participants were informed that the FF task aimed to study individuals' ability to discriminate between real and fake faces. In fact, none of the target faces presented to participants were fake. Angry faces (selected based on the their rated intensity from the NimStim Set of Facial Expressions (Tottenham et al., 2009)), were breifly flashed for 33.33ms (2 frames) before the target stimulus (neutral faces selected from the Multi-Racial Mega-Resolution database (Strohminger et al., 2016)) was displayed. Participants were instructed to indicate whether they thought the target was real or fake by pressing specific keys in a limited span of time (750ms). 


# Data acquisition
## EEG data acquisition

EEG signals were recorded using the EasyCap 64-channel and BrainVision Recording system. Electrodes were placed on the EEG cap according to the standard 10-5 system of electrode placement (Oostenveld & Praamsrta, 2001) and impedance was kept below 12 kOhm for each subject. The ground electrode was placed on the forehead the Cz was used as the reference channel. During recording, the sampling rate was 10000Hz. Note that channels Tp9 and Tp10 were placed near the outer canthi of each eye, and POz as well as Oz were fixed above and below one of the eyes to measure the E0G.



## Physiological data acquisition

Participants' physiological signals, that is their electrocardiogram (*ECG*), photoplethysmograph (PPG) and respiration signals (*RSP*), were obtained at a sampling frequency of 1000Hz. All physiological signals were recorded via the PLUX OpenSignals software and BITalino Toolkit. 

ECG was collected using three ECG electrodes placed according to a modified Lead II configuration, and RSP was acquired using a respiration belt tightened over participants' upper abdomen. PPG sensors, which record changes in blood volume, were clipped on the tip of the index finger of participants' non-dominant hand to meaure heart rate and oxygen saturation.
